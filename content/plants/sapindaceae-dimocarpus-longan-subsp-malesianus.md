Similar to the subsp. longan but different in having leaflets with midrib that are nearly always sunken above, veins nearly always grooved above. Petals woolly, fur-like especially inside. Subsp. longan have midrib not sunk above, often raised, veins slightly raised above. Petals mostly subglabrous, sparsely hairy inside. The fruits generally smaller, 1-2 cm across and have thinner arillode.
