Similar to M. foetida expect leaves with abrupt or shortly tapering tip & blunt to wedge-shaped flowers. Flowers white aging pink, in clusters with yellow-green main stalk and pinkish branches. Fruits obliquely ovoid-ellipsoid or oblong with flat fibrous seeds, sweetly fragrant, without the turpentine-like smell.
